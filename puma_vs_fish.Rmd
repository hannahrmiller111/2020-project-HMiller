It is November 17th, 2020. You are camping in the Indian Peaks and have just run out of food. But COVID is raging, Trump is still president, and avocados haven't been on sale at King Soopers for two weeks, so you are staying put. You have a fishing rod and your specialized mountain lion suffocating gear (your bare hands). You are trying to decide whether fish (from the nearby lake) or puma have lower methylmercury levels and therefore which one you should hunt to eat. 

Fortunately for you, you discover a boulder near your camping spot with some very helpful information carved onto its surface left by a scientist having an existential crises about their only mark on the world being unread journal arcticles. This information is compiled into a table below to ease the strain on your weary, hungered eyes. 

```{r "load packages", include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# Rock info

```{r}
rock_etching_info <- tibble(
  species = c("lake diatoms", "lake zooplankton", "lake fish", "terrestrial vegetation", "spiders", "puma"),
  d_13C = c(-13,-14,-15,-29,-28.5,-24),
  d_15N = c(-0.6,3.2,5.5,-3.5,1.2,7.2)

# Mapping out potential food chain 

![Aquatic and terrestrial trophic levels](trophic_levels.png)


#Q1. How much C in puma come from aquatic sources? Save aquatic fraction as f_aq.

$$
\delta^{13}C_{puma} = f_{aq} \cdot \delta^{13}C_{aq} + (1-f_{aq})\cdot\delta^{13}C_{terr}\\
\downarrow\\
f_{aq} = \text{ equation here}\\
$$
```{r}
f_aq <- 
  
f_aq
```


Solution: ___ of carbon eaten by puma is originally sourced from the lake versus the land

#Q2. What trophic levels are fish and puma at? 

$$
\text{Fish Trophic Position} = 1 + \frac{\delta^{15}N_{fish} - \delta^{15}N_{aq}}{\epsilon_{trophic}}\\
\space\\
\text{Puma Trophic Position} = 1 + \frac{(\delta^{15}N_{puma} - [\delta^{15}N_{aq} \cdot f_{aq}+\delta^{15}N_{terr}\cdot(1-f_{aq}) ])}{\epsilon_{trophic}}\\
\space\\
\epsilon_{trophic} = +3 
$$


```{r}
rock_etching_info # rerun to have easy access to values 

fish_troph <-
  
fish_troph
  
puma_troph <- 
  
puma_troph
```

#Q3. Let's assume the MeHg in the lake is measured at 4.5 ng/g and that it increases 3X at each trophic level. We know all the carbon consumed by fish comes from the lake, so that is easy to calculate. For the puma, let's assume no MeHg is coming from the terrestrial environment, so we can use the f_aq value calculated above to determine the amount of MeHg getting into the puma. 

## Q3A. How much MeHg is in the fish?

```{r}
MeHg <- 4.5 
MeHg_fish <- 
  
MeHg_fish
```


## Q3B. How much MeHg is in the puma? 

```{r}
MeHg_puma <- 
  
MeHg_puma
```

# Q4.

## Puma or fish?
